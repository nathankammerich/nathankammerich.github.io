        My name is Nathan Kammerich, and I’m in my fourth year at Mizzou as an IT major. I first experimented with web design in 
    high school, and I’ve taken a couple of web development related courses here at Mizzou. My expectations are to get more familiar 
    with it because it’s been a year or two since I’ve done anything web related. I’m also hoping to get a good idea of whether 
    this is something I want to make a career out of. I think it could be cool to use a portfolio website I use in this class 
    to actually show employers, or at least put on my resume. My favorite hobbies are hanging out with friends and playing the drums. 
    I spend an hour or two a day practicing. I also really enjoy listening to music.
