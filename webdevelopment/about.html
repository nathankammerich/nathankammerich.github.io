                <b>Hello</b>, my name is <em>Nathan Kammerich</em> and welcome to my website! <br>
                This website is being built to showcase my past work and what I have learned in highschool and college.  
                You will see my resume, a video resume, a portfolio section with some of my projects, and my work experience.  
                My goal with this is to show what I’ve been working on, and the skills that I have acquired that could be beneficial to the workplace.
            </p>
