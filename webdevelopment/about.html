                <p>
                    My name is Nathan Kammerich, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri where I study information technology.  
                    My biggest passions in life are music and technology.  Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a love for anything related to technology.  
                    This includes video games, computers, the internet, etc.  
                </p>  
            </div>
            <div class="item4">
                <p>
                    I took this class because I’ve always been interested in web design, and 
                    after finishing this class I’ll meet all the requirements for an additional certification with my degree.  I love to listen to music, and 
                    I also enjoy making it, I play both the saxophone and the drums.  I grew up in Columbia Missouri, so I’ve been here my whole life so far.  
                    I figured out pretty quickly as a child that I wanted to go to Mizzou because I wouldn’t have to pay out-of-state tuition, and it 
                    had a lot of ways I could continue to play music while also furthering my career.
