                <h3>Highschool</h3>
                <p>
                    In highschool, I was able to take career center classes to try and figure out what I 
                    wanted to do with my career. I’ve always been fascinated in technology and what can be
                    achieved, and this love was furthered in the coding classes that I took at the career center. I
                    received credit for programming I and II at college, and learned a lot about C++/good coding
                    practices, which proved to be very helpful in college. I also took some classes centered around
                    digital media and use of the adobe suite. This is what inspired me to pursue a minor in digital
                    storytelling to complement the IT major.
                </p>

                <h3>Early College</h3>
                    
                <p>
                    Early college was also a time of exploration. I was set on IT at this point, but since the
                    field is so broad with so many potential career options, I was trying to make my way through all
                    of these gen-ed requirements so I could focus more on classes for my major. I got most of these out 
                    of the way in the first couple years, which gave me time to adjust to college. The first
                    year was all online due to COVID-19, but afterwards I was able to take some classes in person,
                    which was helpful for me.
                </p>

                <h3>Late College</h3>

                <p>
                    In the past year or so ago, I’ve had to start narrowing down my preferences. I think I
                    have identified digital media work to be my strong suit, and I am also very interested in a career
                    in web design/development, or UX design. My plan is to work an internship over the summer to
                    further identify what kind of job I want, and gain some real work experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Job</h3>

                <p>My time at Hy-Vee over the past 6 years has taught me so much about how to be a good
                worker, a good person, a good co-worker, and more. Spending this much time at this job meant
                I learned a lot of different skills and became very easy to adapt to new environments and tasks.
                I think my communication skills have grown a ton, and my work ethic has also stayed strong
                during the 6 years.
